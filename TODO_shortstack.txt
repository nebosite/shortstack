    [x] Slightly more details in the help to explain steps
    [x] Specify assignees in git config   [shortstack] reviewers

    [x] SS: identify when the associated PR is closed
    [x] ss merge

NEW    
    [ ] SS: "Your new statck is ready! "
    [ ] SS: default on purge should be to purge remote. Add -notremote parameter
        [ ] Purge should also close pull requests
        [ ] Account for accidental syncs already in the remote
    [ ] SS:  need a way to push current changes backwards for when I accidentally go forward
    [ ] SS: Merge should not attempt push if there is no PR for that level
    [ ] SS: Error: This repository moved. Please use the new location:
        - happens when the last item in the stack has no commits
    [ ] SS: when merging from stuff that was done by another user
        Error: To github.com:nebosite/clusterfun-server.git
        !       refs/heads/eric/manifest/001:refs/heads/eric/manifest/001       [rejected] (non-fast-forward)
        Done
        Pushing to github.com:nebosite/clusterfun-server.git
        error: failed to push some refs to 'github.com:nebosite/clusterfun-server.git'
        hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind
        hint: its remote counterpart. Integrate the remote changes (e.g.
        hint: 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
        hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
        .
        Please fix by hand and rerun the command.
    [ ] Purge should show warnings for branches that are ahead of main
    [ ] SS: Landing as you go is important

    [ ] SS: regular user install is broken 'missing tsconfig.json'
    [ ] SS: Make the finalization easier

        


IMPORTANT

SOON
    [ ] ss new Corner cases:
        [ ] untracked changes warns user to use --force to continue
        [ ] If current branch is not ahead of previous branch, don't create a new one. 
        [ ] If user has accidentally git pushed changes, detect that
    [ ] Start unit testing some of this
    
LATER
    [ ] Enhance status to show levels that have unresolved commits
        - should be able to see commits in the PR
    [ ] Enhance status to show needed merges

=============== DONE =========================================================
